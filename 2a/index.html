    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Award-winning professional training QA Ltd was formed in 1985 by three former Intel employees: Mike Cheeseman, Jim Watt and Howard Kornstein. The name was inspired by a combination of Queen Anne House in Cirencester, the company's first offices, and the term 'quality assurance'. The trio soon moved into the Cirencester Park Estate, where the Earl Bathurst was their landlord. We pride ourselves on the unrivalled quality of the training delivered by our experienced learning teams. Every course will teach relevant new skills that can be applied back in the workplace to improve performance. We offer a range of flexible learning options to suit different learning styles and accommodate busy schedules, including traditional classroom courses, innovative virtual training and a range of eLearning solutions. If you have any queries or comments, please contact: Sheldon Cooper, Webmaster
